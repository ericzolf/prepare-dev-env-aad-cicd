Call `./create_inventory.sh <GUID> <RHPDS-USERNAME>` 
e.g. `./create_inventory.sh e1bc hacker-redhat.com` after you've created your lab from https://rhpds.redhat.com/

It will create an inventory file ansible-cicd-lab.local.inventory that you can use to develop and do first test of your playbooks and roles.
